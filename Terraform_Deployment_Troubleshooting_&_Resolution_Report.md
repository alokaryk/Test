<h2>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for Deployment Failures</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core issue preventing the cluster deployment was not a single problem but a cascading failure caused by <strong>Incompatible Provider Dependencies</strong> and a subsequent <strong>Infrastructure Resource Bottleneck</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Primary Cause: Provider Incompatibility and Syntax Churn</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fundamental initial block was the constant incompatibility between the desired provider and the specific version of Terraform/Proxmox VE 8.4.0 environment.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Provider Lookup Failure</strong></td>
<td>The widely used providers (<code>telmate/proxmox</code>, <code>bpg/proxmoxve</code>) were either <strong>deprecated or retired</strong> from the HashiCorp registry, or their new names (<code>bpg/proxmox</code>) were conflicting with local cached metadata, causing <code>terraform init</code> to fail repeatedly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Configuration Syntax Errors</strong></td>
<td>The installed provider, <strong><code>bpg/proxmox v0.84.1</code></strong>, has <strong>extremely strict HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) parsing rules</strong>. It rejected nearly all attempts to use common Terraform structures, such as inline blocks (<code>cpu { cores=4; type="host" }</code>), nested structures (<code>initialization { ipconfig { ... } }</code>), and complex dynamic logic (<code>depends_on</code> calculations).</td>

<h3>2. Secondary Cause: Infrastructure Resource Bottleneck</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the syntax was resolved, the deployment failed due to system limitations on the Proxmox host.</p>

<td><strong>API Timeout (HTTP 596)</strong></td>
<td>Terraform attempted to clone and start <strong>7 large Virtual Machines (VMs) simultaneously</strong>. This massive, instantaneous I/O load overwhelmed the Proxmox API service (<code>192.168.1.2</code>), causing the connection between the Terraform Host and the Proxmox API to time out repeatedly after the default 30-minute window.</td>

<h2>Resolution Strategy</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution required dual-focus fixes: stabilizing the code syntax and restructuring the infrastructure deployment logic.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Code Fix (Provider &amp; Syntax):</strong> The configuration was stabilized by performing a forced provider switch to <strong><code>bpg/proxmox</code></strong> and meticulously expanding all HCL blocks into the verbose, multi-line format required by the provider. The final code is highly verbose but syntactically acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Fix (Sequential Deployment):</strong> To solve the API timeout, the problematic dynamic <code>for_each</code> loop was entirely abandoned. The final structure uses <strong>seven individual <code>proxmox_virtual_environment_vm</code> resource blocks</strong>, linked explicitly with <strong>static <code>depends_on</code> chains</strong>. This ensures the VMs are deployed one after the other (Bastion &rarr; Control-01 &rarr; Control-02 &rarr; ... &rarr; Worker-03), eliminating the simultaneous I/O bottleneck.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The final successful action was running <code>terraform apply</code> after implementing the fully manual, sequential dependency chain and verbose HCL syntax.</strong></p>
